##RhoMobile With Google Analytics

###Overview
This is a simple mobile web app that demonstrates how easy it is to implement Google Analytics into your RhoMobile Application.

This is a web app that has an employee social network, a store, and a It help request button. These are to show how Aanlytics.js can be used to track events, pageviews, and social interactions.

There are two versions of the web app included in this repository, one with the analytic code inside, and one without the analaytic code already written.

###Helpful notes 
Most of the files we are working with can be found inside of Public/WWW

The images for the web app can be found in the assets folder

If you want to use the app with the analytic code already written, make sure to update the `index.html` page with your **unique tracker ID**
